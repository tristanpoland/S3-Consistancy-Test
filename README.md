```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/S3-Consistancy-Test.git
cd S3-Consistancy-Test
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/S3-Consistancy-Test` (or `.exe` on Windows).

## Configuration

Create a `config.toml` file with your S3 connection details:

```toml
# S3 Configuration
endpoint = "https://s3.amazonaws.com"
region = "us-east-1"
bucket = "your-test-bucket"
access_key = "your-access-key"
secret_key = "your-secret-key"
path_style = false
```

### Configuration Options

## Architecture

The tool is built with a clean, modular architecture:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs          # Application entry point and orchestration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.rs        # Configuration loading and validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.rs         # Data structures and CLI definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tester.rs        # Core S3 testing logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cleanup.rs       # File cleanup and signal handling
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ statistics.rs    # Statistical analysis and reporting
```

### Key Components

- **Configuration Management**: Robust TOML-based configuration with validation
- **S3 Testing Engine**: Handles uploads, consistency checks, and timing
- **Cleanup Manager**: Ensures no test files are left behind
- **Statistics Calculator**: Comprehensive analysis with percentiles
- **Report Generator**: Beautiful console and JSON output

## How It Works

1. **Upload Phase**: Creates unique test files with random data and uploads them to S3
2. **Polling Phase**: Continuously attempts to read each file until it becomes available
3. **Timing Measurement**: Records precise timestamps for propagation duration calculation
4. **Cleanup Phase**: Automatically removes all test files with retry logic
5. **Analysis Phase**: Calculates comprehensive statistics and generates reports

## Use Cases

### Performance Testing
- Measure S3 service consistency behavior
- Compare different S3 providers
- Validate SLA compliance

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Monitor consistency degradation over time
- Alert on unusual propagation delays
- Track performance across regions

### Research & Analysis
- Study eventual consistency patterns
- Analyze the impact of file size on propagation
- Generate data for academic research

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Errors**
```
Failed to initialize S3 tester: Failed to create S3 bucket handle
```
- Verify endpoint URL is correct
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure credentials have proper permissions

**Permission Errors**
```
Upload failed: Access Denied
```
- Verify access key and secret key
- Ensure bucket exists and is accessible
- Check IAM permissions for PUT/GET/DELETE operations

**Timeout Issues**
```
Consistency test timed out after 300 attempts
```
- Increase `--max-wait` parameter
- Check if the S3 service is experiencing issues
- Verify bucket is in the correct region

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging for detailed information:

```bash
cargo run -- --config config.toml --verbose
```

This shows:
- Individual upload operations
- Each read attempt with timing
- Cleanup operations and retries
- Detailed error messages

## Performance Considerations

### Optimal Settings

- **Test Count**: 10-50 files for good statistical accuracy
- **File Size**: 1KB-10KB for reasonable upload/download times
- **Check Interval**: 50-200ms balances precision vs. load
- **Max Wait**: 120-300s depending on expected consistency times

### Resource Usage

- **Memory**: Minimal (< 10MB typical)
- **Network**: Proportional to file size √ó test count √ó attempts
- **Storage**: Temporary (files are cleaned up automatically)

### Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/S3-Consistancy-Test.git
cd S3-Consistancy-Test
cargo test
cargo clippy
cargo fmt
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
cargo test

# Integration tests (requires S3 credentials)
cargo test --test integration
```

## Security

- **Credentials**: Never commit credentials to version control
- **Permissions**: Use minimal required S3 permissions (GET, PUT, DELETE on test bucket)
- **Cleanup**: Tool automatically removes all test data
- **Reports**: Be cautious sharing JSON reports as they may contain sensitive configuration
